# autograding-example-cpp-catch


## Full-Name-Of-Student

**TODO - Please put your name in this README**

## Problem Description

This part describes the activity. This example activity consists in fixing two functions: one that adds two integers, and another that multiplies two integers.

## Objective

- Make the code pass correctly on all tests
   * only change the allowed files to achieve this goal (see instructions below with specific rules).

- The GitHub Actions should present a green marker when all tests are satisfied, and a red X when some (or all) of tests fail. 
    * **Advice 1:** You can click on the red X to verify which tests have failed (or if code didn't compile correctly) via Github repository Actions.
    * **Advice 2:** If no autograding test appear, contact instructor.

## Instructions

- You can ONLY change files `student.hpp` and `README.md`!
   * In file `student.hpp` put your implementations, and in `README.md` put your full name.
- You can add other c++ header and source files and ensure you reference them in the student.hpp and added in the compilation path of the makefile; make sure you add them and check into Github repository

Explanations for the other files:

- file `tests.cpp` has all tests for the required activity (DO NOT CHANGE!)
- file `catch_amalgamated.cpp` and `catch_amalgamated.hpp` has the testing library CATCH2 v3 (DO NOT CHANGE!)
- file `makefile` has the commands for executing activity (DO NOT CHANGE!)
- file  `appTests` will be generated after compiling (if you want to test locally, just execute it; watch out the difference between Windows, Mac, and Lunux)

## Commands for Local Testing via Terminal

- Command to build and execute tests: `make test`
    * If executable is built already, just type: `./appTests`

## Notes

- The code will be evaluated only if compiling! 
   * The reason is, if it doesn't compile, it won't be possible to generate the executable and to perform tests.

- Some test cases may receive individual grade, while others may only receive grade if passing together (or even all tests passing together).

- The final grade will be given automatically on every *commit*, and will only be evaluated until the deadline of the activity.

- The deadline is defined in GitHub Classroom
   * in case you cannot find it, ask the instructor or the course webpage

ask question and check all other rules with instructor.
